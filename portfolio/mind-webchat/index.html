         <h1>Creating a mental health support web chat</h1>
         <h2 id="the-goal">The goal</h2>
<p>Mind is a mental health charity that provides advice and support to empower anyone experiencing a mental health problem.</p>
<p>Often users of <a href="www.mind.org.uk">Mind’s website</a>
 are trying to understand and get help with their own mental health, or supporting loved ones with theirs.</p>
<p>The UK healthcare system regularly fails to provide personalised and timely mental health support to people in need. Charities like Mind can fill that gap.</p>
<p><img src="/img/mind/webchat/access_issues.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I worked to ensure the right people got the right support at the right time when using Mind&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I ended up designing a web chat that would appear at timely moments to offer interactive, personalised support to users.</p>
<p><img src="/img/mind/webchat/webchat_chat.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="the-design-process">The design process</h2>
<p>There were a number of problems to consider when designing a solution</p>
<h3 id="the-right-type-of-communication">The right type of communication</h3>
<p>Mind had previously run user research with people with mental health problems to understand their thoughts on Mind&rsquo;s Infoline, a number you can call to get support. I reviewed this research and learned that for over half of those interviewed, speaking on the phone would be a barrier to getting support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One user explained &ldquo;I would feel very anxious talking on the phone with a stranger about difficult feelings or personal problems&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another noted &ldquo;I spend so much time calling people to chase up support, it is exhausting&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/img/mind/webchat/stigma.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Messaging can feel quicker and easier than picking up the phone, or arranging to speak with someone face to face.</p>
<p>This is why I designed a solution where users could message instead of calling; it fulfilled a user need that Mind wasn&rsquo;t currently meeting.</p>
<h3 id="the-right-place">The right place</h3>
<p>I wanted to test a minimum viable version of the web chat. This meant choosing a few places that it should initially appear on the website, before rolling out more widely if it was successful.</p>
<p>I used data from Google Analytics to identify priority areas to introduce web chat. For example, Mind&rsquo;s website  includes a large library of &rsquo;types of mental health problem&rsquo;. Analytics showed me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>over 85% of site visitors use this library</li>
<li>over 50% of the page views in this library are distributed between five top subjects</li>
</ul>
<p>Introducing web chat on these topic pages would support the most significant number of users seeking information and support.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/most_popular_mind_pages.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I also reviewed feedback on webpages to identify priority areas to introduce web chat.</p>
<p>On webpages dealing with particularly sensitive topics such as suicidal feelings or self-harm, users regularly expressed frustration that they couldn&rsquo;t get timely support when dealing with these feelings. A web chat on these pages would provide an immediate option to get support to extremely vulnerable people who need it urgently.</p>
<p><img src="/img/mind/webchat/waitlists.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="the-right-time">The right time</h3>
<p>Mind&rsquo;s website personas demonstrate that users don&rsquo;t always want the same kind of support; some want to browse information privately and uninterrupted, others want to reach out and communicate.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want users to feel pressured by a web chat, or overwhelmed but it&rsquo;s presence on every webpage they visited.</p>
<p>I worked with developers to ensure the web chat only appeared after a user had been on the page for 30 seconds, or had scrolled through a quarter of the content.</p>
<p>I also ensured those who didn&rsquo;t want to chat could dismiss the pop up window, and it would not appear again until their next website session.</p>
<p>Finally, I wrote warm, informal copy for the web chat to ensure users who didn&rsquo;t want to talk did not feel pressured, and those who did felt supported and encouraged to begin a conversation. I aligned the content with Mind&rsquo;s tone of voice and style guide.</p>
<p><img src="/img/mind/webchat/webchat_request.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I ran user testing to refine and iterate this copy and the speed at which the chat appeared until users felt comfortable with the web chat.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-performance">Measuring performance</h3>
<p>To continually improve the tool, I ensured that web chat support staff measured important data about each conversation they had. This included reason for the chat, resources recommended to the user, satisfaction with the chat, on which webpage the web chat conversation originated and more.</p>
<p>This data supports Mind to build a better website; in fact, I noted that many users were recommended to join Mind&rsquo;s online community <a href="https://sidebyside.mind.org.uk/" target="_blank">Side by Side</a>
, and further research revealed that awareness of this tool was very low among users. This ultimately led to a rebrand of the community in 2020, and a review of how and where it was signposted on Mind&rsquo;s website.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The result</h2>
<p>I designed a web chat that provides timely, interactive, easily accessible support for people in need, in a climate where it can be very difficult to access to mental health support.</p>
<p>It meets a communication need that Mind wasn&rsquo;t meeting before, and it is being continually improved for users based on user insights.</p>
