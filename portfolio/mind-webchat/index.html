         <h1>Mind&#39;s web chat</h1>
         <h2 id="the-goal">The goal</h2>
<p>The goal was to offer the right support for the right people at the right time on Mind&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>Often users of Mind&rsquo;s website are facing serious difficulties, like trying to understand their own mental health or supporting loved ones with theirs.</p>
<p>We knew that many people browsing mental health information and support could benefit from an opportunity to get interactive help from a real person, in addition to the guidance on the page.</p>
<p>Our goal was to design something that prompted or enabled people to reach out and get support if they wanted it. This was a preventative approach; providing the earliest possible support with a real person could prevent that user from SOMETHING&hellip;</p>
<p>Our MVP was a web chat that would pop up over a small number of pages, only when advisors are available&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>There were a number of things to consider when designing the web chat</p>
<p>The right place
Mind&rsquo;s website includes a large library of types of mental health problem. Each problem has its own website area, including descriptions of the problem, causes, treatments and useful contacts. We hypothesised that the most useful place for the web chat to pop up would be on the &lsquo;useful contacts&rsquo; pages of Mind&rsquo;s most popular topics. We reviewed analytics to identify these.</p>
<p>There are many topics on Mind&rsquo;s website that are particularly sensitive and could require more support, such as webpages discussing suicidal feelings or self-harm. We hypothesised that users on these pages could benefit the most from an option to reach out to someone and talk.</p>
<p>Mind&rsquo;s website also includes &lsquo;Contact us&rsquo; information. We hypothesised users would expect to see</p>
<p>The right time
Our website personas showed us that users don&rsquo;t always want the same kind of support; some want to browse information privately, others want to reach out. We didn&rsquo;t want users to feel pressured by a webchat, or overwhelmed but it&rsquo;s presence on every page they visited.</p>
<p>User testing showed that when the web chat appeared after 30 seconds, people felt it was more personalised to their experience.</p>
<p>Those who didn&rsquo;t want to chat could dismiss the pop up window, and it would not appear again until their next website session.</p>
<p>A sustainable success
Introducing a web chat meant Mind investing more time and resource into a new way of providing support. Devised a way for telephone support staff to retrain as web chat support staff, web chat between calls.</p>
<p>Chat would only appear when an adivsor marked themselves as online and available, meaning never flooded with requests to chat that we couldn&rsquo;t fulfil</p>
<p>Staff would finish each chat with a brief survey; topics discussed, support recommended - and the system would also capture key information about the length of their discussion. Reviewing this data showed us how to improve our website, where next to roll out the web chat function</p>
