         <h1>Mind&#39;s crisis tool</h1>
         <h2 id="the-goal">The goal</h2>
<p>The goal was to design a safe space for people in mental health crisis to manage their feelings and self-regulate.</p>
<p>We know that our health system often fails to get people with mental health problems the urgent help they need; this is not a solution but an interim support system while people wait for help.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>There were three key design challenges</p>
<h3 id="creating-distraction">Creating distraction</h3>
<p>Through user research and research with medical experts I learned that, at crisis point, many people need positive distraction to help them self-regulate. This helps them cope until they get the support they need, or have managed their feelings enough to not need urgent intervention.</p>
<p>I needed to create a sense of distraction and exploration using only webpages, because this was what time and budget allowed.</p>
<h3 id="duplicating-content">Duplicating content</h3>
<p>Desk research very quickly revealed thousands of digital services designed to support people with their mental health. I didn?t want to duplicate these effective options. Users come to Mind?s website for support because they trust the brand, so I knew we could be a trusted source to signpost to other resources.</p>
<h3 id="ensuring-safety">Ensuring safety</h3>
<p>While distraction is the right approach for some crisis situations, there will always be cases where urgent intervention by someone else is needed. I needed to design for this possibility.</p>
<h2 id="the-design">The design</h2>
<p>SOMETHING ABOUT <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/need-urgent-help/" target="_blank">Mind&#39;s crisis tool (opens in new tab)</a>
</p>
<p>To ensure safety, before taking the user directly to any information or distraction resources, the design provides an option to &ldquo;Get emergency advice&rdquo;. This takes users to a page which tells them who to contact for emergency intervention if needed.</p>
<p><img src="portfolio/static/img/portfolio/get_emergency_help.mov" alt="Text here"></p>
<p>Once they reach the &ldquo;crisis resources&rdquo; section of the tool, the design provides multiple options. Within each section there are more clusters of resources and suggestions. Users can move around and explore, with tools and interactions wherever they go. This creates the distraction required to self-regulate.</p>
<p>All links to external resources open in a new tab; this means the user can always come back to where they were, and don?t get lost in the web.</p>
<p>All resources and suggestions in the design are community sourced, from user research with people who have been at crisis point. I did not try to replicate things they found helpful, or create a Mind-branded version of these, instead I signposted to them. Mind is a trusted brand, I used this trust to guide people to other reliable and effective resources.</p>
