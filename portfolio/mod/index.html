         <h1>Army careers transformation</h1>
         <h2 id="the-goal">The goal</h2>
<p>The goal was to tell all personnel across the Army about the CASTLE Careers Transformation Programme, so they know how it would affect them, what benefits it would bring and why they should care. I would use internal channels to do this.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>The CASTLE Team weren?t familiar with user-centred design principles, and the intranet pages they had created were long and confusing, full of dead-end journeys, filled with team jargon and not centred around user needs.</p>
<p>I needed to help the team get to grips with user-centred design approaches, understand their users and improve content to deliver CASTLE?s key messages effectively.</p>
<h2 id="the-design">The design</h2>
<p>The first step in this project was to properly identify user and business needs. I worked with representatives from across the teams different workstreams to define what we wanted to tell our users, and reviewed existing user research to understand what our users needed from us.</p>
<p>I ran a workshop to prioritise those themes</p>
<p>IMAGE HERE</p>
<p>I then coached colleagues to wireframe the page design, noting that our highest priority content should come at the top of the page, and that we should give users what they need up front rather than sending them down rabbit holes of information.</p>
<p>I led the team to create desktop and mobile wireframes. This was important for two reasons: because the intranet rendered differently on different devices, and because a high proportion of Army personnel only have access to digital via a phone.</p>
<p>I drafted the content with the team, encouraging colleagues to use plain English and avoid team jargon; I introduced them to tools like Hemingway to check their work.</p>
<p>we get much better reporting on who has looked at what, and users can also leave comments, so that we can understand what content is performing well vs. poorly and keep improving.</p>
<p>I also led us to think about the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I supported the team to design reusable content that could be used not only on intranet webpages, but across all our engagement work; concise summaries of who we are and what we do, user tested for clarity, that the Communications team went on to update across our channels. This not only improved our?. But created brand consistenty.</p>
<p>I equally encouraged the team to consider the wider picture of how people would arrive at our intranet pages, by leading us in a journey mapping activity. This led us to collaborate with other teams to improve our existing digital signposting and to add more where we identified gaps.</p>
<p>The outcome? New, digestible content with a simplified layout, easier to navigate and understand, capturing all the important information in one place. It can be reached by a range of related routes and channels, and importantly can be accessed with ease on mobile or desktop. STATS HERE.</p>
<p>The lasting impact?
Able to track and review
Changed behaviours -
This work also left a user-centred design legacy. I taught colleagues new skills such as how to understand who your users are, how to map and prioritise content based on user needs, how to wireframe a webpage. Those colleagues are empowered to keep using those skills in my absence, and across wider pieces of work.</p>
