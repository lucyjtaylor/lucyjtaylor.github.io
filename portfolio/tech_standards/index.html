         <h1>Designing technology guidance for all UK schools</h1>
         <h2 id="the-problem-space">The problem space</h2>
<p>Schools having the right technology could significantly improve the quality of education in the UK.</p>
<p>Using technology can improve pupil outcomes, save costs and reduce workloads for busy teachers.</p>
<p>But, there are huge variations in the type and quality of technology currently used in education settings across the UK.</p>
<p>This means there are variations in the quality of educations pupils get - and the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted this more than ever before.</p>
<p>I was the Lead Content Designer creating a guide for all 24,000+ schools and colleges across the UK, explaining what technology they should be using to maximise the quality of education, and how to get it.</p>
<p><img src="/img/tech_standards/standards_scope.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="the-design-process">The design process</h2>
<p>There were XXXXXX main design challenges&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="the-volume-of-content">The volume of content</h3>
<p>I worked with technical experts who could talk for days about what technology schools should be using. But user research showed us that time-poor schools didn&rsquo;t have time or capacity to digest a lot of information. I needed to find a way to get the most important information from experts, and condense it into something manageable.</p>
<p>To deal with the volume of content, I designed content commissioning templates based on user research.</p>
<p>I set principles for how to write a technology standard and provided guidance for technical experts on how to write the content.</p>
<p><img src="/img/standard_principles.png" alt="">
<img src="/img/standard_template.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This meant that experts drafted content in a repeatable pattern. It saved us hours of effort. Before I intervened, the team received over 45 pages of long-form content that required 6 hours of conversation to understand and restructure. After, we received less than 20, concise pages of structured information that I could immediately design into a prototype for rapid user testing.</p>
<h3 id="writing-for-a-mixed-audience">Writing for a mixed audience</h3>
<p>The goal was to get schools to buy and use better technology. This meant educating school staff about the right things to buy, and how.</p>
<p>But user research also showed us that schools rely on suppliers to carry out upgrades.</p>
<p><img src="/img/tech_standards/supplier_insights.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I needed to write guidance that was high-level enough that it could be understood by the non-technical school staff, but also detailed enough for technical suppliers to consistently carry out changes.</p>
<p>Our first hypothesis was that we would need to provide detailed, technical content to schools. They would skim over it, pass it on to suppliers and expect them to understand and enact it.</p>
<p>So I wrote in a detailed, technical style targeted primarily at suppliers.</p>
<p><img src="/img/tech_standards/technical_language" alt=""></p>
<p>But user testing showed that schools simply struggled to understand the guidance and wouldn&rsquo;t use it as a result:
<img src="/img/tech_standards/prototype_fail" alt="">
<img src="/img/tech_standards/prototype_fail2" alt=""></p>
<p>I worked with user researchers to affinity sort quotes and behaviours from the user testing sessions, and a strong theme emerged: schools wanted to feel empowered.</p>
<p><img src="/img/tech_standards/UR_stickies" alt=""></p>
<p>So, I took a different angle. Instead of writing primarily for suppliers I wrote primarily for school staff.</p>
<p>I designed a structure that would break down the complex, technical information to make it digestible to non-technical audiences, as well as including a section of detailed technical specification for suppliers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What:</strong> a concise sentence, understandable by non-technical users, describing the standard they must meet</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> a short description of why schools must meet this standard, why it is important; this isn&rsquo;t an arbitrary ask but will add value to education</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When:</strong> when to make the change, with advice such as &ldquo;do this when your current contract is up&rdquo; or &ldquo;do this at the same time as doing that&rdquo; if there are interdependencies</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How:</strong> a detailed explanation of what to do, who to ask for support, what to ask them in order to meet the standard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Technical requirements:</strong> a section of detailed, technical requirements, designed for suppliers to use. Schools can hand this to suppliers and be confident the work will be done to the expected standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This structure would empower schools to understand their technology, as well as giving enough detail to suppliers to make necessary changes.</p>
<p><img src="/img/tech_standards/what_why_when" alt=""></p>
<p>In our first prototype, 0% of users were able to identify the standard we were asking them to meet, and almost none of the users said they would use the guidance.</p>
<p>Now, the results were totally different. Schools understood what was being asked of them, and were able to benchmark themselves against the guidance.</p>

<h3 id="making-content-digestible">Making content digestible</h3>
<p>I had designed a tried and tested, user friendly content structure, but there was still a lot of information for schools to absorb.</p>
<p>To help users digest the volume of content, I chose an accordion format. This allows the user to expand or contract the information as they process it, rather than being hit with a wall of text.</p>


<video width=100% controls>

<p>User testing showed that this worked well for users; some chose to &lsquo;show all sections&rsquo; and expand the whole accordion at once, while others picked through areas of interest one by one. This format gave both types of user a way to digest the information that worked for them.</p>
<h2 id="the-outcome">The outcome</h2>
<p>I designed guidance that over 24,000 schools and colleges in the UK will use: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-digital-and-technology-standards-in-schools-and-colleges" target="_blank">Meeting digital and technology standards in schools and colleges</a>
