         <h1>Technology standards for schools</h1>
         <h2 id="the-goal">The goal</h2>
<p>The goal was to create a guide for all 24,000+ schools and colleges across the UK, explaining what technology they should be using and how to get it.</p>
<p>There are variations in the type and quality of technology currently used, meaning variations in the quality of educations pupils get. This was a policy-driven effort to even the playing field.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>There were two main design challenges.</p>
<h3 id="the-volume-of-content">The volume of content</h3>
<p>I worked with technical experts who could talk for days about what technology schools should be using. But user research showed us that time-poor schools wouldn?t be able to digest a lot of information. I needed to find a way to get the most important information from them.</p>
<h3 id="the-mixed-audience">The mixed audience</h3>
<p>The goal was to get schools to buy and use better technology. This meant educating school staff about the right things to buy, and how. But we also knew schools would rely on suppliers to carry out upgrades. I needed to write guidance that was high-level enough that it could be understood by non-technical school staff, but also detailed enough for technical suppliers to consistently carry out changes.</p>
<h2 id="the-design">The design</h2>
<p>To deal with the volume of content, I designed content commissioning templates based on user research.</p>
<p><img src="/img/standard_template.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I set principles for how to write a technology standard and provided guidance for technical experts on how to write the content.</p>
<p><img src="/img/standard_principles.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I designed a repeatable content pattern that allowed us to communicate to both technical and non-technical audiences. This structure was based on rounds of user research that helped us identify what users needed from our content. It included the &lsquo;what, why, when and how&rsquo; for non-technical audiences, as well as a detailed technical specification for suppliers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What:</strong> a concise sentence, understandable by non-technical users, describing the standard they must meet</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> a short description of why schools must meet this standard; this isn?t an arbitrary ask but will add value to education</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When:</strong> when to make the change, with advice such as &ldquo;do this when your current contract is up&rdquo; or &ldquo;do this at the same time as doing that&rdquo;; there are interdependencies</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How:</strong> a detailed explanation of what to do, who to ask for support, what to ask them in order to meet the standard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Technical requirements:</strong> a section of detailed, technical requirements, designed for suppliers to use. Schools can hand this to suppliers and be confident the work will be done to the expected standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I chose an accordion format, to help users digest the volume of content. This allows the user to expand or contract the information as they process it, rather than being hit with a wall of text.</p>
