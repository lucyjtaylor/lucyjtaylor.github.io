          <p>I have designed and improved digital services across 5 government departments, often working on projects of national scale; <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y2ysEe8_F4hRLv90pTFTfbX2n9Anzizy/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">read my CV</a> for snippets of what I&rsquo;ve done at the Office for National Statistics, Ministry of Defence, Department of Health and Social Care, Home Office and Department for Education.</p>
<p>I have worked in content design, UX design and user research, as well as having roles as a service manager, delivery manager and data analyst.</p>
<p>My wide range of experience means I can do a bit of everything - manage complex projects and stakeholders, understand user needs through research and data, and design content to meet those needs. Here are some brief examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the Office for National Statistics I collaborated with developers to design elements of the 2021 UK Census, such as <a href =?https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/censustransformationprogramme/questiondevelopment/searchasyoutypeandaddresslookupfunctionalityforcensus2021#address-look-up-functionality? target=_blank?>address look-up functionality</a> that was used throughout the digital form. I organised and led usability testing of the tool, summarised insights, prioritised improvements to add to the development backlog, and iterated the content myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the Department of Health, during the Covid-19 pandemic, I led a team of data scientists to build operational data dashboards for senior decision makers. I analysed and shaped the data as well as leading the visual design, to create a digestible and user-friendly view of complex information. These dashboards enabled senior staff to make critical, operational decisions during the pandemic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the Ministry of Defence, I uncovered and mapped a complex, confusing digital landscape of over 50+ Army digital tools. They were all accessed via different routes, optimised for different devices, and often had duplicated functionality or content. I created a strategy to improve access and reduce duplication; now there is one entry point known as <a href=?https://www.ejsu.net/EJSUNET/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jive-Responsive-App-MyArmy.pdf? target=blank?>MyArmy</a> for everything Army personnel need - and bonus, it uses a system the MOD already had.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also written up a more detailed example of my work at the Department for Education, designing guidance for over 24,000+ schools and colleges across the UK.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="example-work-designing-technology-guidance-for-schools">Example work: Designing technology guidance for schools</h2>
<p>I was the Lead Content Designer creating a guide for all 24,000+ schools and colleges across the UK, explaining what technology they should be using to maximise the quality of education, and how to get it.</p>
<p>Why? Because schools having the right technology could significantly improve the quality of education in the UK.  Using technology can improve pupil outcomes, save costs and reduce workloads for busy teachers.</p>
<p>But, there are huge variations in the type and quality of technology currently used in education settings across the UK. This means there are variations in the quality of educations pupils get. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted this more than ever before.</p>
<p>Research showed us that many schools weren&rsquo;t sure what technology to use to create the best learning environment for students. Even those that did know weren&rsquo;t sure how to get it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where designing technology standards comes in: it will support and empower schools to know what steps to take to improve their tech, and set a benchmark they must meet.</p>
<img src="/img/tech_standards/standards_scope.jpg" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
</br>
</br>
<h2 id="the-design-process">The design process</h2>
<p>There were 3 main design challenges when designing technology standards for schools:</p>
<ol>
<li>The volume of raw content to design</li>
<li>A mixed audience of experts and novices</li>
<li>Creating a digestible design</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-volume-of-content">The volume of content</h3>
<p>I worked with technical experts who could talk for days about what technology schools should be using. I needed to find a way to get the most important information from technical experts, and condense it into something manageable I could design with.</p>
<p>To deal with the volume of technical guidance that experts were capable of producing, I designed content commissioning templates based on user research.</p>
<p>I set principles for how to write a piece of guidance, and provided instructions on how to write the content.</p>
<img src="/img/tech_standards/standard_principles.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
</br>
</br>
<img src="/img/tech_standards/standard_template.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
</br>
</br>
<p>This meant that experts drafted content in a repeatable pattern, and only wrote what we needed.</p>
<p>It saved us hours of effort. Before I intervened, the team had received over 45 pages of long-form content that required 6 hours of conversation to understand and restructure.</p>
<p>After, we received less than 20, concise pages of structured information that I could immediately design into a prototype for rapid user testing.</p>
<h3 id="writing-for-a-mixed-audience">Writing for a mixed audience</h3>
<p>The goal was to get schools to buy and use better technology. This meant educating school staff about the right things to buy, and how.</p>
<p>But user research showed us that schools rely on suppliers to carry out upgrades.</p>
<img src="/img/tech_standards/supplier_insights.jpg" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
</br>
</br>
<p>I needed to write guidance that was high-level enough that it could be understood by non-technical school staff, but also detailed enough that technical suppliers could use these instructions to carry out changes.</p>
<p>Our first hypothesis during alpha was that we should provide detailed, technical content to schools. They would skim over it, pass it on to suppliers and expect them to understand and enact it. The upgrades would be made and schools would meet the standards.</p>
<p>So in our first designs I wrote in a detailed, technical style, targeted primarily at suppliers. But user testing showed that, because schools struggled to understand the guidance, they wouldn&rsquo;t use it as a result:</p>
<img src="/img/tech_standards/technical_language.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
</br>
</br>
<img src="/img/tech_standards/prototype_fail.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
</br>
</br>
<p>What to do, then? I worked with user researchers to affinity sort quotes and behaviours from the user testing sessions, and a strong theme emerged: schools wanted to feel empowered.</p>
<p>So, I took a different angle. Instead of writing primarily for suppliers I wrote primarily for school staff.</p>
<p>I designed a structure that would break down the complex, technical information to make it digestible to non-technical audiences, as well as including a section of detailed technical specification for suppliers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What:</strong> a concise sentence, understandable by non-technical users, describing the standard they must meet</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> a short description of why schools must meet this standard, why it is important; this isn&rsquo;t an arbitrary ask but will add value to education</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When:</strong> when to make the change, with advice such as &ldquo;do this when your current contract is up&rdquo; or &ldquo;do this at the same time as doing that&rdquo; if there are interdependencies</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How:</strong> a detailed explanation of what to do, who to ask for support, what to ask them in order to meet the standard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Technical requirements:</strong> a section of detailed, technical requirements, designed for suppliers to use. Schools can hand this to suppliers and be confident the work will be done to the expected standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This structure would empower schools to understand their technology, as well as giving enough detail to suppliers to make necessary changes.</p>
<img src="/img/tech_standards/what_why_when.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
</br>
</br>
<p>In our first prototype, the one that was targeted towards suppliers, 0% of users were able to identify the standard we were asking them to meet, and almost none of the users said they would use the guidance.</p>
<p>Now, the results were totally different. Schools understood what was being asked of them, and were able to benchmark themselves against the guidance.</p>

<img src="/img/tech_standards/pie_chart3.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
</br>
</br>
<h3 id="making-content-digestible">Making content digestible</h3>
<p>At this point I had designed a tried and tested, user friendly content structure, but there was still a lot of information for schools to absorb.</p>
<p>To help users digest the volume of content, I chose an accordion format. This allows the user to expand or contract the information as they process it, rather than being hit with a wall of text.</p>
<p>

<video width=100% controls>
<source src="/img/tech_standards/standards_manual.mov" type="video/webm">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


<br>
</br></p>
<p>User testing showed that this worked well for users; some chose to &lsquo;show all sections&rsquo; and expand the whole accordion at once, while others picked through areas of interest one by one. This format gave both types of user a way to digest the information that worked for them.</p>
<h2 id="the-outcome">The outcome</h2>
<p>I designed guidance for GOV.uk that over 24,000 schools and colleges in the UK will use: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-digital-and-technology-standards-in-schools-and-colleges" target="_blank">Meeting digital and technology standards in schools and colleges</a></p>
<p>Not only this, but I secured resourcing to make sure schools would have the finance and support to actually apply this guidance.</p>
<p>I argued to senior policy-makers that written guidance alone did not meet user needs; it would tell schools what to do, but in an under-funded system it wouldn&rsquo;t support them to actually make the changes. I supported my team to create a new vision, and persuaded the department to secure resourcing to realise it.</p>
<p>Written standards for schools are only the start and centre of the project. They will be followed by specific guidance for different educational settings, and most importantly additional services that help schools to actually achieve the standard.</p>
